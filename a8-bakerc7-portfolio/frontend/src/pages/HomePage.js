                <h3>Career Goals</h3>
                <p>I am currently progressing through a computer science program in order to change career fields. Through this program, I am developing my skills in various aspects of computer 
                    science to provide myself with a broad range of skills that will allow me to be more versatile in the field and to help narrow down my interests. I have a background in science with a biology degree, and I am still
                    interested in that field as well. My long term plan is to combine both degrees for use in my career. Ideally, I would like to either work in scientific software development
                    or the field of data science. I believe I will be well prepared for enteirng either of these areas upon graduation of this program.

                        <li><strong>Node</strong> is a powerful JavaScript runtime environment that is designed to operate on a server. It is capable of creating dynamic webpage content. With Node,
                        forms can be used to collect data. It allows adding, deleting, and modifying data in a database, making it an essential tool for server side development.</li>
                        <li><strong>Express</strong> is an essential tool for developers to build web applications. It handles routes, requests, and responses. It is used in conjunction 
                        with Node to seamlessly handle forms for data collection as well as modyfying data in a database.</li>
                        <li><strong>MongoDB</strong> is a widely used database management system. Data is stored in a similar fashion to that in JSON files. It is well suited for dynamic data, such
                        as that collected from web applications.</li>
                        <li><strong>React</strong> is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces in web applications. It allows interaction from a user through a webpage without the need for the page
                        to reload. React also allows for reusable function type components, making the development process modular and overall more effecient.</li>
